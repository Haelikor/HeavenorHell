Ducks!

March 5th, 2019 -- I went through and did some "remanagement" of the original HoH Discord server. Just to see if anyone'd take the bait. Sure enough, one of the people too busy to post in the event had time to rearrange roles for 11 channels. How odd!

March 4th, 2019 -- Round V began February 25th. One week later, today, a grand total of 7 replies have been made so far in the entire round! Special honor to the 0 replies between Team Smash and Sass vs. Team D.A.T.A.S.S, and Team Mountain vs. Team Hold My Beer! Sugoi!

March 3rd, 2019 -B -- Added some more locations for our handy reminders!

March 3rd, 2019 -- Ishnaelyr says he was busy transitioning into his new life as "neo nazi dragon overlord supreme," but he'll post soon!

March 2nd, 2019 -- lot of ducking! Get to posting! Sad!
